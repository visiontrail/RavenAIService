"""HTTP-level tests for the Admin model-settings routes.

The service-level tests already cover validation. What only shows up over real
HTTP is the request-model layer: FastAPI silently drops body keys the pydantic
model does not declare, so a setting can be accepted with 200 and then never
persist. That failure is invisible from the service side and looks, to an
admin, like a form that "won't save".
