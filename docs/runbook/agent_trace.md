# Runbook: Agent Trace Channel

Operational reference for the SSE-based agent trace channel introduced
in the `stream-agent-trace-to-ui` change. Background and schema:
[../agent_trace_protocol.md](../agent_trace_protocol.md).

The trace channel is best-effort: a degraded or missing trace stream
MUST NOT block a successful log analysis result. Use the diagnostics
below in the order they appear; most symptoms can be cleared without
touching the agent loop itself.

---

## Symptom 1 — Redis unavailable / trace SSE returns no events

**What users see**

- Log detail page opens, AI analysis is running, but the trace card
  list stays empty.
- Refreshing after the task finishes still shows traces (because they
  were persisted to `LogRecord.ai_analysis_result.trace_events`),
  confirming the problem is the in-flight Redis path only.
- Chat trace stream (`/ai-chat/log-analysis/stream`) is unaffected
  because it does not depend on Redis.

**Where to look**

1. App logs for `TraceBuffer: ...` lines.
   - `failed to build redis client`: client construction failed —
     `redis` package missing or invalid `app.config.settings.redis_*`.
   - `pipeline write failed task_id=...`: connection succeeded once
     but later writes are failing; Redis is likely under memory
     pressure or being restarted.
   - `read failed task_id=...`: SSE endpoint cannot poll; usually
     Redis network blip.
2. Redis health:
   - `redis-cli -h $HOST -p $PORT ping` — expect `PONG`.
   - `redis-cli ... INFO memory` — if `used_memory_rss` is close to
     `maxmemory`, eviction can drop trace keys.
3. Confirm a key exists for an in-flight task:
   - `redis-cli ... KEYS 'ai_analysis:trace:*'`
   - `redis-cli ... LLEN ai_analysis:trace:{task_id}` — should grow as
     the agent runs.

**Resolution**

- If Redis is fully down: trace channel for in-flight runs is lost;
  finished runs still serve traces from the DB. Confirm the agent
  itself completed successfully (`LogRecord.ai_analysis_status`).
- If pipeline writes are timing out: bump `socket_timeout` /
  `socket_connect_timeout` in [agent_trace_redis.py](../../app/services/agent_trace_redis.py)
  *temporarily*, find the root cause (Redis CPU, network), revert.
- If Redis is full: free memory or raise `maxmemory`; agent trace
  keys carry `EXPIRE 3600` so they should reap themselves within the
  hour.
- Do **not** kill the Celery worker to recover trace — the analysis
  result is the authoritative output and it is unaffected.

## Symptom 2 — SSE connection drops mid-stream

**What users see**

- A trace card list that froze mid-run, often after ~30–60s of an
  idle long-running tool (e.g. `git clone`, large `Read`).
- Browser network panel shows the SSE connection closed with no
  `done` / `run_complete` frame.

**Where to look**

1. Confirm the agent is still alive by checking the Celery task
   state (`celery -A app.celery_app inspect active`) or, for the chat
   path, the in-memory `AgentJob` state. If the agent finished but
   the client never received `run_complete`, the drop is downstream.
2. Reverse proxy / load balancer timeouts — most common cause.
   - `nginx` default `proxy_read_timeout` is 60s. The trace stream
     emits a `system_notice{kind: "heartbeat"}` frame every ≥ 15s of
     silence, but only if the upstream sends. Confirm
     `proxy_read_timeout` is **≥ 120s** for the trace endpoints.
   - Check for buffering: `proxy_buffering off;` MUST be set on
     `*/trace/stream` and `*/log-analysis/stream` location blocks.
3. Browser side: confirm the EventSource was not garbage-collected
   (`AIChat.vue` keeps it on the message; `LogDetail.vue` closes it
   when the component unmounts).
4. Heartbeat presence: with the developer tools open, you should
   see `event: agent_trace\ndata: {"type":"system_notice","kind":"heartbeat",...}`
   at least every 15s during long tool calls.

**Resolution**

- Raise the upstream `proxy_read_timeout` to a value greater than the
  longest realistic tool duration (e.g. 300s for `git clone` against
  slow remotes).
- Ensure `proxy_buffering off;` and `X-Accel-Buffering: no` are set;
  the FastAPI route also emits the header but a misconfigured proxy
  can still buffer.
- The frontend will automatically reconnect (chat) or display the
  finalised result on reload (log detail) — no server-side action is
  needed once the proxy is fixed.

## Symptom 3 — Events appear out of order or are missing in the UI

**What users see**

- Tool card output looks chopped or shows the wrong status (e.g.
  `running` after the task is clearly finished).
- `trace_summary.tool_call_count` in `run_complete` does not match
  the number of cards rendered.

**Where to look**

1. **Always check `seq` first.** Inspect a few raw frames in the
   browser network panel — they MUST be strictly monotonic per
   `task_id`. The frontend
   [`useAgentTraceStream`](../../frontend/src/composables/useAgentTraceStream.ts)
   re-orders and de-dupes by `seq`, so client-side display order
   should match `seq` regardless of arrival order.
2. Backend buffer integrity:
   - Chat: `AgentJob.trace_events` should match `AgentJob.events`
     filtered by `event == "agent_trace"` (same payloads).
   - Celery: `LRANGE ai_analysis:trace:{task_id} 0 -1` should yield a
     `seq`-increasing JSON sequence (use `redis-cli ... | jq .seq`).
3. List truncation: if `LLEN ai_analysis:trace:{task_id} == 2000`,
   the bounded `LTRIM` dropped early events. This is by design but
   may indicate a runaway agent — check the task's tool call count
   in the analysis result.
4. Reconnect contract: when the client passes `?from_seq=N`, the
   endpoint serves only `seq > N`. A bug at the call site (e.g.
   passing the wrong cursor) will look like missing events. Confirm
   the query string by reproducing manually:

   ```bash
   curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "https://.../api/v1/logs/{log_id}/ai-analysis/trace/stream?from_seq=0"
   ```

5. Persistence check (post-task): after a run completes, the events
   are written to `LogRecord.ai_analysis_result.trace_events`. If
   that field is missing or empty but the task succeeded, the agent
   wrote the legacy fields only — check
   [app/tasks/ai_analysis.py](../../app/tasks/ai_analysis.py) hasn't
   been refactored to drop the trace plumbing.

**Resolution**

- Missing because of `LTRIM`: increase `MAX_TRACE_EVENTS` in
  [agent_trace_redis.py](../../app/services/agent_trace_redis.py)
  (current cap 2000) — only as a stopgap; investigate why the agent
  is producing so many events.
- Missing because of `from_seq` mishandling: file a bug against the
  client; the SSE endpoint contract is `seq > from_seq` so the
  client should remember the highest `seq` seen and pass it on
  reconnect.
- Out of order arrival but correct render: nothing to do; the
  frontend composable handles re-ordering.
- Out of order arrival AND wrong render: capture the raw frames and
  attach to the bug; suspect a regression in
  `LogAnalysisAgent._RunState.seq_counter`.
