RavenAIService is the core service repository of the Raven intelligent testing platform. The platform is evolving from a single-purpose log tool into a multi-project, multi-agent general testing platform, built around **project-based management, multi-agent collaboration, device integration, and version asset governance** for complex testing scenarios.

Logs, AI, devices, code assets, and releases are no longer isolated modules — they are organized by “project” and driven by specialized agents, forming a closed-loop collaboration across testing, R&D, delivery, and operations.

## Product Positioning

Raven focuses on recurring pain points in testing workflows and is evolving toward a true platform:

- logs come from many places and are hard to standardize or reuse
- complex logs are expensive to process and slow to investigate
- troubleshooting is still heavily experience-driven and difficult to scale
- platform workflows and device workflows are disconnected
- packages, releases, and test assets are scattered across tools
- different projects and teams lack a unified testing backbone

RavenAIService is built to turn those fragmented steps into a more complete intelligent testing flow:

- organize logs, code repositories, agent skills, and analysis results around **projects** as the core unit
- use a **multi-agent architecture** (general chat, log analysis, device operations, code expert, bug fix, package search) so each scenario is handled by the most appropriate agent
- automate complex log processing and reduce waiting time
- connect platform and device capabilities into a closed-loop workflow
- centralize software packages and client releases for better governance
- support Chinese / English multi-language UI for global teams

## Platform Value

- **Project-based management**: logs, repositories, and agent skills are organized per project — each team gets its own context
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: general chat, log analysis, code expert, device operations, bug fix, package search — the platform automatically routes to the best agent for each scenario
- **Higher testing efficiency**: logs, AI, devices, and admin workflows live in one place
- **Faster issue turnaround**: teams move from upload to analysis with fewer handoffs
- **Better asset reuse**: logs, analysis results, package data, and actions become reusable knowledge
- **Global support**: the frontend supports Chinese / English switching for multi-language teams

## Typical Scenarios

- Admins create projects for different products / teams, link code repositories, and configure per-project agent skills
- Test teams ingest logs in batches, archived by project, for fast filtering and analysis
- The platform auto-detects different log types and routes them into the right processing flow
- Test and R&D engineers ask questions in AI Chat — GeneralAgent routes to log analysis, code expert, device operations, or other agents as needed
- BugFixAgent takes log analysis conclusions and automatically locates code, generating fix suggestions
- The platform forwards AI instructions to target devices and waits for execution results
- Product versions and delivery packages are managed through one traceable asset center

## Platform Overview

The repository includes these platform modules:

- `FastAPI` main service: core business flows for logs, AI, users, devices, projects, and releases
- `Vue 3 + Vite` console: the unified multi-language web workspace for testers and administrators
- `Multi-agent engine`: GeneralAgent (router), LogAnalysisAgent, DeviceAgent, ProjectExpertAgent, BugFixAgent, PackageSearchAgent
- `Celery + Redis`: asynchronous execution for log processing, AI analysis, and maintenance jobs
- `Nginx`: a single external entry to simplify deployment and access

## Capability Map

### 1. Project-Based Management

- Logs are no longer classified by type alone — they are linked to projects via `project_id` for multi-project isolation
- Each project can be linked to one or more code repositories, providing knowledge sources for the code expert agent
- Per-project agent skill configuration lets admins enable or customize agent behavior for each project
- Admin console provides project repository management, skill configuration, model settings, and usage statistics

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration Engine

The platform includes six specialized agents, unified by GeneralAgent routing:

| Agent | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **GeneralAgent** | General chat entry point; automatically routes to specialized agents based on user intent |
| **LogAnalysisAgent** | Intelligent log analysis combining log parsing, metadata, and project context |
| **DeviceAgent** | Connects to devices via WebSocket to execute remote operations and relay results |
| **ProjectExpertAgent** | Answers source-code-level questions based on the project's linked repositories |
| **BugFixAgent** | Starts from log analysis conclusions, locates code issues, and generates fix suggestions |
| **PackageSearchAgent** | Search across software package assets for package selection and version tracing |

- All agents support streaming responses; the frontend renders Markdown and Mermaid diagrams in real time
- AI chat sessions support pinning, Markdown export, drag-and-drop log file upload, and more
- **Agent-driven clarification (AskUserQuestion)**: when a request is ambiguous, the DeviceAgent may decide on its own to ask one or more clarifying questions (each with 2–4 preset options plus free-text input), then continue once answered. It reuses the human-in-the-loop pipeline and the question card survives disconnect/refresh. Users self-manage three preferences in **Settings**:
  - **Globally disable clarification** (on by default): when off, the agent never pauses to ask and proceeds with its own understanding;
  - **Max questions per run** (default 5): beyond the cap the agent decides on its own;
  - **On timeout**: after waiting 5 minutes, either *cancel this run* (default) or *continue with what it knows*.

### 3. Test Log Asset Management

- Supports multiple log upload entry points
- Auto-detects different log types; logs are archived by project
- Extracts `metadata.json` from archives to enrich issue, environment, and version context
- Complex logs are processed asynchronously via Celery with automatic retry on startup
- Provides pagination, filtering, sorting, single download, batch download, and batch delete

### 4. Platform-to-Device Collaboration

- Devices register through `WebSocket /ws/device-link` for a unified connection entry
- The service tracks online state, capability descriptions, and last heartbeat
- DeviceAgent can forward instructions to a specific device and wait for the device response
- Devices can report capabilities so the platform can generate better-matched action chains

### 5. Version Asset Center

- The FastAPI backend handles software package upload, delete, detail, download, and batch download
- Provides package search and filtering API
- Admin UI can upload Linux / macOS / Windows client release artifacts

### 6. Platform Operations and Monitoring

- System-level and user-level AI usage statistics; admins can view agent call trends in the console
- Online editing of prompt configuration, model settings, user management, and release management
- Admin authentication is configured in `app/admin_auth.yaml`
